# Data-Journalism-and-D3

Here we are finding a correlation between two data variables, each measured state by state and taken from different data sources.

We will be doing the analysis and the visualization of the health risks facing particular demographics for the year 2014.

The data for the demographics is taken from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey(ACS).
And, the data on "health risk" is taken from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System(BRFSS).

The code is developed using D3, the JavaScript library for visualizing data with HTML, SVG, and CSS.
